This plugin offers a fix to 2 PVP issues raised by m5k

-> A Player can return multiple times to battle after dying
-> There is not enough punishment when a Player dies

It offers to fix these issues by

-> Allowing admins to set a soft limit on dying, after you exceed this limit you will be punished by respawning with less health

-> Create a time limit after a Player dies they will have to wait x seconds before being able to attack another player.
